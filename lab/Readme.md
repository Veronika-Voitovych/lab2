# Laboratory work 2

# Description

1. Solving a quadratic equation using a complex program.
2. Determination of the number of the quadrant in which the point with the given coordinates x, y is located.
3. Determine whether the given number is two-digit and even.
4. Using a conditional operator, write a program to calculate f(x).
5. Using the selection operator, write a program so that the number of the day of the week prints whether it is a working day or a weekend, considering Saturday and Sunday as weekends, the number of the month indicates which season it belongs to, the number of the month prints the number of days in it.
   Creation of a text menu, in which when selecting the first item a greeting is displayed, when selecting the second item - an invitation to work on the computer, when selecting the third - it is suggested to complete the work. Writing a program that, based on the number of the pair (a natural number from 1 to 4) on this day, gives the name of the item on this pair. The variable min contains a number from 0 to 59. Output to the console in which quarter of an hour this number falls (in the first, second, third or fourth). Creation of a text menu, in which the value of the product of two numbers is calculated when the first item is selected, the value of the sum of two numbers is selected when the second item is selected, and the value of the difference is selected when the third item is selected.
